Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks-First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
THe Art of the Deal-"The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT CAP and BALANCE.
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.
@johnboehner Message for House GOP  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it." - The Art of the Deal.
@Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq? What are u doing about this?

House GOP wants to cut Medicare Obama took $500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare. Both Wrong!

@BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Arab world does not like it  
US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US-and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower Chicago are on the list!
Take a look at   
CUT CAP AND BALANCE. TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY!
What is better advice- "The Art of the Deal" or "Rules for Radicals"? I know which one @BarackObama prefers.
Who will be the next @TheRealTeenUSA? Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa.com  #TeenUSA
@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. T-E-A  
@marcorubio is right. We need to create more taxpayers not more taxes. CUT CAP AND BALANCE.   
Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of  their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday.
#trumpvlog The Republicans must act now don't let @barackobama push you around.  
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit.How low have we as a nation sunk?

While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure-as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem-not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy-not cuts on the elderly.
The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama.  
Obama sadly has no business or private sector background-and it shows.
Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions-cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors.
My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox.  
My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends - "GOP Crazy If  They Don't Get Everything They  Want"   
America's debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking.
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves-US needs our toughest negotiator-and fast!
Higher Taxes kill job creation-cut wild government spending and waste.

@BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet. He's totally lost ineffective desperate. GOP has its best chance to make a great deal
I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee a fine American

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan-important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems-Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.

It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mike Huckebee a great guy said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.
Economic growth can save Social Security Medicare and America.
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump-I tell CNBC I am buying stocks- and the market goes up.

@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. Not create any jobs. 2. Borrow more money from China.

There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election.
@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt-will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion.
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership it can be stopped.
America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People.
I'm very proud of the work my son @EricTrump has been doing with the @EricTrumpFDN take a look.  
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime.
There is no substitute for private sector experience.
More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties-I agree.
Hurricane Irene and Libya in today's #trumpvlog.  
Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support-we don't even ask!
Iran admits to aiding the Libyan "Rebels" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn?  
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution.
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber-now.
China's business interests reach far and wide-even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.

We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel-if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it.
My interview with @gretawire last night - "Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'"   
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.
Make no mistake-Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.
Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions.
Oil is double the price now compared to last year-OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama.
Fast and Furious   gun running goes all the way to the White House.  We need answers now!

USA should take oil from Iraq in repayment for their liberation.   
US should have told Libya "Rebels" - give us 50% of your oil for our military support.
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare-not cuts on Seniors.
Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers?
America needs a tough negotiator-not a community organizer.
My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews:  @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'   
My interview yesterday with @IngrahamAngle   
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record.
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @BarackObama is their favorite client.
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program? The US should look at future funding.
@IvankaTrump always makes me proud     
I watched POTUS speech from Europe-same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs.
@BarackObama-the stimulus will fail just like the first.
Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate.  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.  America will boom.
Very exciting. I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal!
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary.
The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world. We have fallen from first under @BarackObama.

I'm urging my friends in Brooklyn to vote for Bob Turner tomorrow-send @barackobama a message.

My thoughts on Gadhafi's death @BarackObama and the misery index.  
Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy not a friend.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.

China's economy is now projected to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2027  
If @BarackObama wanted the "Super Committee" to succeed he would have lead. Instead he has been campaigning. Where is the leadership?

I don't care what people say I like Tom Cruise. He works his ass off and never ever quits. He's one of the few true movie stars.
May jobless numbers have been readjusted to 8.2%.  @BarackObama's economy is a disaster  
Today @BarackObama is in Ohio on a bus tour. Tomorrow Pennsylvania. How about actually running the country?
When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some "ally."

I'm in Scotland to open what we hope to be the greatest golf course in the world- it's amazing.
President Obama wants @MittRomney to hand over even more past tax returns- he should when @BarackObama reveals his college applications.
.@MittRomney should not give any other further information until @BarackObama releases the things that everyone wants to see-
Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority? This is the latest  
The U-6 Unemployment Rate is over 14.9%. ObamaCare is stopping businesses from both hiring and expanding.
The liberal media is focusing on @MittRomney's bank records. How about reviewing @BarackObama's illegal land deal contracts with Tony Rezko?
Everyone is talking about how Trump Tower is the exterior for Wayne Enterprises in Dark Knight Rises-it's true.  
Congrats to @BarackObama-he has now had over 40 months straight of over 8% unemployment while accruing over $6T (cont)

Very strange-why do database records contradict @BarackObama and show he was only at Columbia 1 year?  
Almost daily more discrepancies in @BarackObama's biography continue to arise. Who is this guy?
Even the Left realizes that @BarackObama's policies have led to more jobs being outsourced out of this country.  
.@BarackObama reported over $269710 of foreign income out of his gross $894520 and paid $5841 in foreign taxes

Seth Meyers was terrible co-hosting with Kelly. Marbles in his mouth-&amp; he must stop picking at his hands-insult to the great Regis Philbin!
I wonder why @BarackObama is not going to the NAACP Convention. Is it because he can't answer questions about 14.7% Black unemployment?
America's Olympic uniforms are manufactured in China. Burn the uniforms!#U.S.OlympicCommittee
Nasty  tactics being used by @BarackObama campaign against @MittRomney. Must stop saying Obama is a nice man-he is not!
.@BarackObama wants to see 10 yrs of @MittRomney's tax returns-tell him "ok-but we want to see your college applications first.'
Think of it-20% of our country is essentially unemployed.
Don't believe the lies-every budget @BarackObama has delivered to Congress raises the income tax on EVERYONE  
.@BarackObama should release all his records (like other Presidents).
A true honor. @PressSec considers asking for @BarackObama's college transcripts a "Donald Trump question."  
Penn State is doing a poor job in bringing its mess to a close.They should be ashamed for hiding Sandusky's crimes all these years.
The Football program at Penn State should be suspended.
In his entire political career @BarackObama has never had a tough @GOP opponent before @MittRomney. He is a paper tiger. #GOMITT
For America to be great again we must have a President who has been successful and Americans can learn from on how to succeed.

.@MittRomney needs to make @BarackObama regret that he ever asked for his tax records.
When will we see @BarackObama's passport records (sealed)?
Why would @BarackObama be spending millions of dollars to hide his records if there was nothing to hide?
For the sake of transparency @BarackObama should release all his college applications and transcripts-both from Occidental and Columbia.
Congratulations to John Roberts for making Americans hate the Supreme Court because of his BS   
According to a @gallupnews poll over 60% think ObamaCare will make things worse for taxpayers  
Watch @BarackObama admit Obamacare is a TAX

Weird-why did BarackObama Sr. fail to list @BarackObama as his son in his 1961 INS application?  
Dark Knight Rises is projected to gross over $180 million this weekend. Remember to watch for Trump Tower!
The class warfare being played by @BarackObama is the only way he can get reelected. He can't have America focus on his horrendous record.

Why does HI Revised Statute 338-17.8 allow an HI resident who doesn't have to be US citizen to procure an official Hawaii birth certificate?
So @BarackObama's campaign is calling @MittRomney a potential criminal

The Federal government has $2.7T in assets &amp; $17.5T in total liabilities plus another $4.7T in intergovernmental debt. Have a nice day.
The Audacity of @BarackObama-the Federal Reserve purchased 61% of all debt issued by Treasury in 2011. Killing our children's future.
Price of corn has jumped over 50%. This will cause a jump in food prices perhaps beyond what we've ever seen. Nasty for the economy.

Today I am working on my 'big surprise' for the @RNC convention. Everyone will love it.
Glad to hear @GovChristie will be delivering the Keynote for the @RNC convention. He will deliver a strong message.
By the US winning the Olympic medal count we proved that both the American spirit &amp; talent is greater than a 1.4B population. USA!
Every sports fan is treated to an All Star game. The loyal and growing fan base of @CelebApprentice will be getting a much bigger treat!

The Euro is going to collapse soon. Cross border lending is already down and banks are stopping their Euro investments.
.@BarackObama is promoting ugly inefficient unreliable bird-killing noisy neighborhood-destroying wind turbines. Big mistake.
Nobody wants wind turbines they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy-a disaster for taxpayers.
Watch @PaulRyanVP explain how "'It's irrefutable' that President Obama is damaging Medicare'"  
While @JoeBIden is a gaffe machine yesterday's comments that @MittRomney will "put y'all back in chains" was not at all proper.
Congratulations to @AllenWest on winning last night's primary!
Lightweight reporter Alex Pareene @pareene is known as a total joke in political circles. Hence he writes for Loser Salon. @Salon
I'm really glad that @MittRomney no longer says what a nice guy @BarackObama is.
Richard Mourdock-a very good man running for the Senate in Indiana. Hopefully he will win! @richardmourdock
.@MissTeenUSA visited today-  
Scary thought-what is the pervert Anthony Weiner doing with all the free time he has. Does he collect unemployment?
I have hired renowned golf course architect Gil Hanse to rebuild The Blue Monster at Doral. He designed the 2016 (cont)  
My acquisition of the Doral in Maimi will be a major success for the Trump Organization. The re-building is on schedule.

The @Lakers should have an amazing team next year with Kobe Nash and Howard. Will be fun to watch.
One of the hardest jobs in politics must be cleaning up after @JoeBiden gaffes. I feel sorry for his spokespeople.
Military reps have attacked @BarackObama over Bin Laden leaks-they believe he's just using this for his benefit. Not a big surprise.
The Huffington Post is such a loser-it will die just as AOL is dying What a stupid deal AOL made to buy it!
My interview with Don Imus on @77WABCradio discussing my @RNC convention surprise &amp; @MittRomney's China policy  
What's more dangerous for the country-the Iranian nuclear threat or @BarackObama as President?
I wonder what the work atmosphere is like @VanityFair. It must be hard working at a dying institution.
A great photo of @MittRomney and me  
Certain Internet sites are like a bad epidemic that won't go away-others are terrific
There's only only one person who has defunded Medicare. His name is @BarackObama.
Congratulations to @WWERaw on passing 1000 episodes. @WWE is still going strong after all these years-@VinceMcMahon is great!
I still hold the all-time attendance and pay per view record at @WWE.
There are only 22 days for @BarackObama to drop @JoeBiden. Obama is not a loyal guy. I think he is strongly considering it.
Jennifer Aniston is engaged-she's a great person and I wish her well.
.@Israel could very well be close to attacking Iran. Could be this election's big October surprise.
I always said @BarackObama will attack Iran in some form prior to the election.
Good news - @MittRomney has pulled ahead in Wisconsin   
Palm Springs CA has been destroyed-absolutely destroyed-by the world's ugliest wind farm at the Gateway on Interstate 10. Very very sad!
Wind farms are killing many thousands of birds. They make hunters look like nice people!

.@MittRomney shouldn't give additional tax returns until @BarackObama gives his passport records college records &amp; applications.
.@BarackObama is hiding plenty of bad things.

Great sign:"We built this business without government help. Obama can kiss our a-!"  
Even NY Democrats are avoiding @BarackObama's convention   
Great speech on China by @PaulRyanVP yesterday where he explains why China is treating @BarackObama like a "Doormat"  
.@MittRomney &amp; @PaulRyanVP get what needs to be done to reign in China. @BarackObama gets kicked around by the Chinese.
The US government's foreign debt is at a record $5.29T  
US government's foreign indebtedness has grown over 72% under @BarackObama. He is bleeding us dry to China.
If @BarackObama really loved this country he wouldn't be destroying it. He has ruined our credit and killed jobs with ObamaCare.
Congratulations to @bobmcdonnell on leading Virginia to be in the black for a 3rd straight year. He is a fantastic governor.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM-tune in!

Congratulations to @TheSlyStallone and Arnold @Schwarzenegger on 'Expendables 2' #1 box office opening. Still going strong!
Oil is rising back over $100 barrel. OPEC loves to rip us off. Why shouldn't they-they always get away with it.
Americans already believe that @PaulRyanVP is better qualified to serve as  President over @JoeBiden   
Scary thought-@JoeBiden is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unemployment is up in 44 states showing July's unemployment numbers to be broad based

Glad to hear that @JimTalent has put some strong anti-China referendums in the @GOP convention platform.
It's Tuesday. I wonder how much money @HuffPost lost today-great purchase AOL
.@RogerJStoneJr was great on @TheKudlowReport last night. Roger and Larry are good friends!
Amazing-both Transformers &amp; Dark Knight Rises featured Trump properties and each grossed over $1B. Just coincidence.
Every economic climate whether an uptick or downturn presents new opportunities and challenges.
Distressed real estate opportunities can make great investments. You need the foresight and instincts to know the property's true potential.
Glad to hear @BarackObama's attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina. Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte!
Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming-great all-star cast.
I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father. Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.!
It's amazing how many people still come up to me to thank me for 'The Art of The Deal.' The book has changed a lot of lives.
Many people will be surprised at what is about to be released concerning @BarackObama's background. I for one won't be.

Gas prices are soaring. $4.12 in CA. OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are.
Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @BarackObama can't be bothered he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes.
We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year. That money should be back here financing jobs in America.

Disgusting-@BarackObama's supporters are launching an anti-Mormon whisper campaign   
I am proud of the Tea Party. These great patriots have accomplished so much in strengthening our country in only 3 short years.

Life brings you many surprises. As a child I used to vacation with my family at the Doral in Miami. Now I own it.  
Florida has been very good to me. I am really esxcited to give back at the Sarasota GOP event and @RNC convention. Will be fun!
.@DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America' is expanding to over 1000 theaters this weekend. Will be highest grossing documentary in 2012. !!
It's Friday. How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental &amp; aesthetic disaster.

.@BarackObama sent over 100000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL.
.@BarackObama is begging the Eurozone to keep Greece in until after 11.6.12. He thinks the world revolves around his re-election.
"The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success." -Irving Berlin
Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? No more apologies-take the offensive!
I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and quite honestly wonderful. Now he's gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate. @hardball_chris
One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire.
Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero.
It is very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians.
Look what happened to the autism rate from 1983-2008 since one-time massive shots were given to children- 
"They succeed because they think they can." - Virgil
.@BarackObama has completely failed the American people. U.S. annual incomes have fallen over 5% during his term   
Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer &amp; felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!
As usual the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines &amp; ratings!
The US Navy wants to go "green." Our Navy should use the best &amp; most powerful fuel &amp; not play games. Give me a break!
.@FinancialTimes writes that "@BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US"   
.@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand- more to follow.
The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese-tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges etc
My @FoxNews @TeamCavuto interview discussing the @RNC Convention businesses making products in China and unemployment

Ask China if their rapidly expanding (with our money) Navy or Armed Forces are going "green" - They would laugh in your face!
"Trump urges GOP to be 'mean as hell'"

Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney. We must be united to win!

I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
.@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.
What a coincidence-Michelle Obama called Kenya @BarackObama's "homeland" in 2008   
China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
An excerpt of my @TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota 'Statesman of the Year' dinner discussing the Tea Party  
Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing the 2012 election OPEC ripping us off &amp; @MittRomney's job policy   
Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie. He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention-tell the truth.

I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama   
I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
It's Thursday and again I ask-how much money is China stealing from us?
Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden   
Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand how do OPEC &amp; the speculators get away with this?!
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.
"Let me say it as clearly as possible that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me." - @GovMike Huckabee
The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
"After four  years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney." @PaulRyanVP
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code-makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs    
Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show-calls lots-must apologize for racist comment.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
A fact-golfers don't get aches &amp; pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
It's Friday how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?
Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this.

China is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade  
Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!
Andy Roddick.a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife.
Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?
@MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces &amp; Jewelry. Tune in at 1AM EST!
If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad.leave Clint alone!
Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
As I predicted 1 year ago gasoline prices hit a record high today.OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
"Be  yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." - Steve Jobs
Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal-and commissioned the one sided report.
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. - we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans  
Very good speech by @MichelleObama-and under great pressure-Dems should be proud!
.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous-he is no Lance.
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon @lancearmstrong for events that took place years ago in France?
.@lancearmstrong revise your decision to quit-go back and fight.
With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday it was ironic that the debt passed $16T.
.@serenawilliams is a special player. After winning the Gold for the US in the Olympics it looks like she will (cont)  
Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on-especially the @Late_Show. It's simple-I get the ratings!
I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136260 per household a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc.
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!
Scary thought-is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?
"Change before you have to." -Jack Welch
Other networks are begging me to do a show-I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!
Once again under@BarackObama the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness   
Bill Clinton did a great job last night-the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?
Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you United States for making this possible!
"Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign"   
.@BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention  
Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
After @BarackObama's speech tonight-which should be well delivered-reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip  
"Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people." -@MittRomney
"We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion" - @MittRomney
Scary-while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
Under @BarackObama 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants @GiulianaRancic and me singing "Call Me Maybe"   
The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney.
Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough-and fast!
Drew Peterson a real sleaze just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88921000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is:  
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!
During @BarackObama's presidency median family income has fallen 4.8%  
One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!
"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something sometime in your life." - Winston Churchill

"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people"-Clint Eastwood
Barack Obama used to mock Bush's 300K monthly job reports  
Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background?   
"You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals."-General George S. Patton
Obama called August's job report "progress." Overall 96K new jobs &amp; over 173K new people on food stamps

An impromptu interview I did with German TV on 9/11 down by Ground Zero discussing the attack and WTC Towers  
Discussing the 9/11 attack and coverage with @kingsthings while hosting the 25th anniversary of his @CNN show   
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview with Ken Langone &amp; Dick Grasso discussing the Chicago teachers' strike @ 2012   
"Trump: If Republicans 'don't get tough they're not going to win this election'"  
On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?
China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands   
Priorities-while fundraising and campaigning on our dime Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings   
Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.
"If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party." - @limbaugh
"There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare." - Sun Tzu
I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time.
Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' Complete waste. We need the best &amp; easiest fuel for our military.
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after.
We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans. Obama's foreign policy is a joke.
An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil. We have been attacked by Libya. Go into Libya &amp; take the (cont)  
Obama doesn't know what he's doing. His foreign policy is a disaster. Libya Egypt Iraq Afghanistan-all (cont)  
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again I was right.
Libya is selling its oil to China-I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe.
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job.
The Middle East is blowing up-we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace (cont)  
As bad as they were I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power.
What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil.
It's Wednesday how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off.
So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres. Morsi in the White House  
"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic (cont)  
Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
No surprise. @DNC displayed Russian ships in tribute to vets  
"Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel." - @IsraeliPM @netanyahu
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
"The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary." - Vince Lombardi
Weakness cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama-Israel is in trouble.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster-the worst President we have ever had.
With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
Romney’s campaign is being put on the defensive. He cannot let this happen. Stop pandering. Must get tougher (cont)  
If Obama was smart he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't.
Wake Up America!  See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake"  
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates.
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday September 24 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
It's Thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll   
.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama who put these radicals in power deserves blame.
Welcome to Obama's America-record high poverty and an 8% drop in median household family income  
Congratulations to Obama and the @DNC. The federal deficit has topped $1T for a fourth year in a row  
I keep getting great feedback on new #TRUMP cologne 'Success.' Exclusively available at @Macy's

I hate @USAToday's redesign-the logo is terrible. Lightweight Al Neuharth must've had something to do with this No wonder paper is failing.
@BuckingSlams  Sam you're 100% correct. Frankly I wish they'd scram.

@ScottSaia23 Thanks Scott. I appreciate your nice words.
It's amazing-@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
RT @MittRomney: For nearly 4 years Barack Obama has refused to crack down on China's cheating &amp; American workers have paid the price.
@Steelchecker  Jody-Agreed.
@Shawn_Maynard  This is our 13th season. No precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. Shooting is underway. Will be terrific.
QE3 is going to further sink the dollar into oblivion. Creates artificial numbers for short term market gains. (cont)  
No surprise-Obama's Deputy Campaign Manager tweeted link from Chinese propaganda outlet  
First Obama says Egypt is not an ally. Then he promises to keep handing over aid   
If you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read "The Art of the Comeback."
Hey @KimKardashian-I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.
Weekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.

Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.
Kate Middleton is great-but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude-only herself to blame.
After being ripped off for years Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.
Via @digitaljournal: "Donald Trump tweets Obama is 'an incompetent President'"  
"Trump: If Republicans 'don't get tough they're not going to win this election'"  
Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!
Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal. Now they're just acting for the cameras.
With 50 days until the election it is #TimeToGetTough for @MittRomney &amp; @GOP
Eli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter-an elite quarterback.
Still a buyer's market. Buy directly from a bank. They want to offload properties that have defaulted will give good prices &amp; financing.
While Obama is denying it he did receive intelligence about the attacks 3 days before  
It's Monday how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?
China is now attacking Japan's economy for leverage

@rdowns I never went bankrupt. Enemies love to say I did. Didn't happen.
Now a small country like Sudan tells Obama he can't send any more Marines  
@princeetornam They had both interest and aptitude. They've done a terrific job.
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing QE3 @MittRomney's leaked comments Middle East &amp; US oil capability  
My @nbc @todayshow interview discussing my @RNC video &amp; why @MittRomney should not apologize  
This morning @nbc @todayshow played some of the @RNC video I filmed for the Tampa Convention  
With 49 days until the election @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record.
The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
.@lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land.

Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China-very dumb!

@RowRee It will be fantastic!
@angela_pink_fan @celebapprentice @bretmichaels Tune in!
@danojano @AFreespeechzone  Dopey-I have never filed for bankruptcy (as you know!)
Obama should play golf with Republicans &amp; opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
The stage is set for the real debate-it will be very interesting!
Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.
Oil would be $25 a barrel if our government would let us drill. Our country would be rich again-who needs OPEC.

QE3 a political favor for Obama will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.
Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment!

@Ileschinder @willsommer Not a bad idea.( I'm in a magnanimous mood.)
It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video.

Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.&amp; his father have done an amazing job.great school &amp; the students were fantastic
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records &amp; applications in return?
The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy Obama should be down by 12 points-and he's not.
The Emmys were horrendous.the absolute worst show!
"Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility-no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
The Emmys are all politics that's why despite nominations The Apprentice never won-even though it should have many times over.
All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
Despite all of China's cheating they are not doing that well-we can beat them-our country has great potential!
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
RT @MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again-not to redistribute it.
Today I spoke @LibertyU Convocation a great crowd. 
Scary-Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
Living in denial-only 15% of Democrats think that recent economic news is poor  
Secure your place at the National Achievers Congress in London. It will be an amazing event with a great surprise.  
The debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @MittRomney has proved-in Florida-he delivers under pressure.
Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama.
Coincidence? Obama and Ahmadinejad each describe @Israel's warning over the Iranian nuclear program as just 'noise'  
Muslim Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit. Obama's foreign policy is a complete failure.

Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you "can't change Washington from the inside." Not what he said in '09.

Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses  
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T  
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd - whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
.@jack_welch is correct-these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
Greece should get out of the euro &amp; go back to their own currency-they are just wasting time.
California gas prices going thru the roof others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates the real state of unemployment &amp; bias media  
Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also not a pressure player.
In the end Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again a lot.
George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
"Donald Trump: ‘Monkey business’ on jobs"  
When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly after the election!
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
With these record high gas prices what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts you need to know about real estate.” - Think Like a Billionaire
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David-we are again friends.
By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting I promise.
"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." - Mitt
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate-he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
Remember Obama limped across the finish line-he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
"It doesn't matter who you vote for-it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election we decide whether we become great again.
I just had to fire someone he didn't have a clue-he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
DELUSIONAL-Obama actually thought that he won the debate  
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding  
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
Consumer spending fell in September  
"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird."  - @MittRomney
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
Even with lower profit projections American firms are still throwing money into China  
Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.
I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium &amp; waterfall.
Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad  
@usa67us  Thank you
"When everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it." - Henry Ford
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod-dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod-to put it "mildly" - The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater-just watch!
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
Outright disgusting-the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother  
Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate.should be a great time
Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince  
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription?  
Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data  
.@Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here  
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.- watch.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.
"Wing bangers"- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!
"There are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still." - Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds." Do you believe?
Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world-a great honor for me.
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on-they always win when I am there.
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
With our amazing All Star cast @Joan_Rivers @johnrich @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." -@PaulRyanVP
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate-I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back-I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." - Warren G. Bennis
I told you whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve- they would have won.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
They found Jessica in Colorado- body was mutilated- death to the pervert killer.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore- the real reason.
Tonight despite everything put A-Rod in the lineup.
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter- he is a great champion.
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont)  
No I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go they win.
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
I love @LibertyUniversity-such great people!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue- even though he was on the juice!
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
"Romney Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation"  
Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate  
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night Obama is finished!
"Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride let time go by."Donald J. Trump
"The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government." - @MittRomney
Based on very popular demand I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
"Donald Trump's back with 14 'Apprentice' All-Stars"  
Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney-Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees-he owes it to them-especially with Derek hurt.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight-even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
I can confirm the reports-@BillRancic my first season winner will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have in my opinion zero talent.
.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful-you stupid fool!
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response-dammit I wish the stuff worked.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
It's amazing-my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week-thanks folks!
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me-that's okay I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous-people want to see if he is for real.
.@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 - bad timing I'll be live tweeting the debate
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party-hope he gets the credit he deserves.
Between Libya the national security leaks and Fast &amp; Furious Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
.@washtimes "@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump-'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'"  
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight-have no doubt you will be great.
.@MittRomney-if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts-he will quiet down quickly.
@MissUSA  Olivia-we love you. You are doing a great job.
Get ready for tonight!
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
For political purposes only Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's-thanks!
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment-I agree.
Getting ready to watch the debate- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
Obama keeps saying that he will do something- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama weak on immigration. All words no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton- he is no Bill Clinton.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
You talk tough Mr. President but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Obama better than last time but again @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
Debate showed- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Verlander pitched great but @Yankees look truly defeated.
At the debate the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
Remember I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment.its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it he broke his foot.
I still love Derek he is a winner!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Obama did much better than he did last time-but still lost decisively.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million-&amp; all the "biggies." It's like having your own newspaper.
My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees &amp; how to terminate his contract  
@marileenelson Thanks
Via @espn: "Donald Trump would fire A-Rod"   
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost   
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.
Remember new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
Robert Bryce @NYPost-Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally &amp; aesthetically.
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance.
.Bad decisions can be devastating.
"Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries"   
.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
Obama talks about what he is going to do-why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout   
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for CC
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters even A-Rod they got you there.
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan-he was set up-too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again-just watch. He can do much better!
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.

.@mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back? He is back!
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records-all of them.
Under his administration oil and gas production on public land is down over 10%

"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years." -@MittRomney
Amazing-my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
Alert-US jobless claims up 46000 to 388000. Really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud-not possible!
Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family &amp; the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner
Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again-100 certain-am I ever wrong?

Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays however.
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year the fans will be happy.
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek-only in a Trump building-Trump is lucky for you.
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week-no red tape.
My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records-they are really phenomenal. You can order them at  
@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister.
@NeanderthalMan1 @MittRomney  I was referring of course to Bill Clinton's statement on the economy.
@Morali_Arch Great to meet you also.
@CalumSpence Greatly appreciated thanks.

@Rosie @realDonaldTrump  Thanks for the info Rosie-get well.
.@evaemery Thanks-you sound great!
.@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP-I can't watch this guy anymore!
Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche-much like our President!
It is a great honor to have helped the community so much.  
With Barry Diller &amp; Tina Brown in charge did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?
Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell. I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall.
@evaemery Never give up. You have what it takes.
.@MittRomney did a great job last night. Watch the clip!  
Obama said "not optimal" to Ambassador &amp; embassy killings-bad word usage for a Harvard graduate.
@MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree but their careers weren't fueled by drugs.
@JakfromBk Thanks!

My interview with @IngrahamAngle discussing the real unemployment number and how the 7.8% number is a fraud  
@stu120 No sadly not even close!
Via @CraveOnline: "Donald Trump is NOT A-Rod fan  
Yes-I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal." Just come clean already-tell Americans the truth!
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.
@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great-her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25%

Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.

Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?"  Sad!
.@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low even for them.
Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which under Graydon Carter will be sooner rather than later.
No surprise welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama.  
.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.  What a surprise!
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success- he is a great champion.
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees- he must go.
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac- the cars are fantastic.

Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected-be careful Republicans!

My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick -very thrilling.

The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.

Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years he will thank me. Be smart Robert.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama-just wait and see!
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy  
Well this is it the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
.@MittRomney looks much calmer and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy- and I mean much more.
70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago  
I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping he gave his enemies an opening.
No matter what happens in the election @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it even with his terrible record.

When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "Ok go get him"?
The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden's death not Obama who works hard to take (cont)  
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcement  
.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing not the President.
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden- now he wants all of the credit!
Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert &amp; Kristen.I don't have time except to say "Robert drop her she cheated on you &amp; will again!"
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!

No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble &amp; boss was just fired-they are lost.

You have all been waiting- the response has been amazing! Watch my announcement now press release to follow at 12:15.  
As stated here is the press release.  
The response has been fantastic- actually overwhelming! Thank you!

RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases records  
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008 American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out-when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
I just learned that @politico has no credibility-total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records  
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
. By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public.
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
Just stated by a total pro: "You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."

My @gretawire interview discussing my $5M charitable offer to Obama his lack of transparency &amp; my tremendous support  
I am happy to have started #ObamasFavoriteCharity. Really enjoying reading everyone's tweets.
How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? She is a dummy-just look at her past.
Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic &amp; @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant. Great ratings for Miss Universe.
Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc &amp; @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson.
Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic &amp; @BillRancic did not name their son Donald.  Unbelievable.
.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement-you just don't get it!
.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie. Besides I get great ratings on The View.

“Our side needs Donald Trump.” - @AnnCoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night.  Thanks Ann.
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!
@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost hoped Obama would be great for U.S. - he wasn't.
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.
"Trump Offers To Donate $5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts"  
I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well.  He is a very special player and a great guy.  New York loves him. @yankees
China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports  
Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China"  
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires.
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
"The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants." -The America We Deserve
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
.instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain.
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor-great news for Taylor!
@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide.
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors-Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity.  
@TylarReese Thanks Tylar
@seketa77  I hope so for the charity's sake
@yewkalaylee  Great idea.

I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100.

@MRJMF1 @Late_Show Thanks I will.
@MaureenPeronne @Late_Show  Thanks it was a great show.
@destiny_113 @StephenAtHome  I agree.
@MikeMpef Thanks I hope you enjoyed it had a great time.
What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost. How much longer will Arianna last-I predict not much.
@crushthespirit  True!
A clip from last night's @Late_Show where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades  
Watch me explain on the @Late_Show how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency  
One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer &amp; give $1250000 to each family of the four.  
Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time-and guess who was his guest? DJT
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!
Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
.Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
By the way where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama-now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner-to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio-make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
Sarah Jessica Parker voted “unsexiest woman alive” – I agree. She said “it’s beneath me to comment on the.

Great! Last night @CelebApprentice winner @johnrich &amp; alumni @RealMeatLoaf packed OH stadium rallying w/ @MittRomney  
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
If my offer is refused every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say?
Watch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer. No one approves (cont)

Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was “professionally dead.” I saved her tiny.  
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But he just doesn't have what it takes.and he never will.

@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly.you're terrific!
@BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did .and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!
A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers - I agree.
.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body - so I won't. Is this a double standard?
While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill you are no Letterman.

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US-the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama.
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings-emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.

So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium-they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.
Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze.  
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower call office.
All weights are on crane's wrong side -  very precarious below move out!
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
Not only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President - don't fall for it.
Because of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium -   unlike others I stayed open.  
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes @MittRomney wants to lower taxes-need I say more!
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm-thanks staff!
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help - I say thanks to you!  
The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm  
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama  
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.

How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12 the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
Let’s be honest if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity-for Red Cross or another great charity
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.  
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
China’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses  
Fans shouldn't worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.

The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity- or to which charity the money will go.

How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media.  
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
In the spirit of transparency Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.

There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice once he releases all of his records.
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show-&amp; his ratings stink. You'd think @HBO could do a lot better.

President Obama please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
President Obama if it is important to you I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President-give me a break.

Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China-and will!
President Obama missed the deadline!
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
Press release. Video response to follow.  
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.  
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records he would have refused.
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications - they are just not willing to say!
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp; websites as to their professionalism &amp; fairness—many people asking for this.
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose-this can't be good for Obama.
With long gas lines &amp; total disarray from storm the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
.@Chrysler disputes my statement-but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't-stay tuned!
.@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language-not very professional.
.@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her-sadly I won't be able to do it.

Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.  Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.  Kick him out of office tomorrow.
Tune in for #TrumpTuesday on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow morning.
Go out and vote- this will be the most important election of our time!
Answer to your questions- I will be voting at 10:30 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street Manhattan
I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight - win lose or draw I’ll be there!
Why is Obama playing basketball today? That is why our country is in trouble!
Before you vote think: Obama wants to raise taxes @MittRomney wants to lower taxes-need I say more!
Despite the upcoming election the cover of paper-thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln-sad!
The Apprentice was the #1 show on television last season on Sunday from 10 to 11 - congratulations Donald!
"If you voted for Obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for Romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid." Thanks Walter D!
Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M-just to show simple records. He's hiding lots!
@SpencerLJackson  Yes!
@jtylerdowling   Thanks
@NGen52  I never went bankrupt.
Me voting- it really is my hair!  
Watch this behind the scenes video of @IvankaTrump's Fall 2012 collection photo shoot-  
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
In the 1950’s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years.
The New Black Panthers are back at the same Philly polling station from '08  
Make sure to vote today.  Vote for real change.  Change that will deliver jobs and a free &amp; strong America.  Vote for @MittRomney.
Very dangerous pattern developing across country by Obama supporters.  Detroit poll watcher was threatened with gun  
Save Medicare.  Vote for @MittRomney.  He will repeal Obamacare on day one.

More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama. Pay close attention to the machines don't let your vote be stolen
Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. If you have any problems notify the poll workers.
Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ &amp; Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY &amp; NJ are still decimated by Sandy.  Wrong!
Now Chinese state run companies are taking over our coal market  
If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters make sure you report it immediately.
Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12  
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
@Tappersong  Thanks Gary.
The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.  There is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet.
.@ABFalecbaldwin  Alec-it's not science it's a con-read the e-mails.
The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.
Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off? Make America strong vote for @MittRomney.
I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney &amp; @MittRomney this past year. They love America. Let's push them over the top today.
I love show "Law and Order" but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever. No talent-unwatchable!
.@MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent-why did they ever put him on "Law and Order?"
Whoever wins today remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling. Our work is not done until America is strong again.

Well back to the drawing board!
We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!
Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble.like never before.
Our nation is a once great nation divided!
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years.stay strong and never give up!
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.

.@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.
The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster!
.@bwilliams-wouldn't you love to have my ratings?
The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!
Brian-Thanks dummy-I picked up 70000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @NBCNightlyNews
Brian I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much-look at what's happening to nightly news.
Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. People will learn the truth! @NBCNightlyNews
Brian if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it-reasons why to follow.
Another four years-not good for the country but we'll have to live with it!
Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together!
We have to make America great again!
It's freezing and snowing in New York-we need global warming!
Amazing various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements- but media doesn't care about.  
Pervert alert.  @RepWeiner is back on twitter. All girls under the age of 18 block him immediately.
Millions without electricity across NY &amp; NJ. The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in the Republicans lost. What a waste of money.
The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.
It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.  We will fight on!
Now that the election is over watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China-my prediction.

A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).
Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy &amp; the death &amp; destruction it caused.
.I  trounced him in ratings &amp; Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday. Brian—are you irrelevant?
Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night I was on last Thursday
It is that time of the year.  The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.  The greatest ice rink in the country.
Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!
Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again  
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
.@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi.
With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.
At the end of the day Obama won the battleground states by less than 500000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes  
China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine  
Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio &amp; he would be President.
Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
Of the 9 battleground states we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP &amp; glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.
The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart.I hope!
I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help.
I got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country!
9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last &amp; yet the Republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong!
@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxter—Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap &amp; boring documentary is a tremendous flop.
Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!
.@antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
.@antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?
.@antbaxter Dummythanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof &amp; Aberdeen seeing big benefits.

She’s baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it won’t help- she’s got no talent &amp; no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
Everybody wants me to talk about Robert Pattinson and not Brian Williams—I guess people just don’t care about Brian!
I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport a terrible situation!
Wow  I never saw the Petraeus thing coming. A straight laced guy! Very sad for him and his family.
I'm a skeptical guy but I don't believe Petraeus used this to get out of the Benghazi hearings.

Surprise-In a post-election delayed release food stamp rolls surged to biggest monthly increase and an all-time high  
Businesses have already started massive layoffs and reducing employees’ hours due to Obama Care.  Reality is setting in.
How come every time I show anger disgust or impatience enemies say I had a tantrum or meltdown—stupid or dishonest people?
No surprise that @BBC is in a major scandal for shoddy journalism.  Any network that air’s @antbaxter’s garbage has zero credibility.

Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households.  With Obama Care taxes kicking in now everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.
.Remember-I told you so.
Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation.
This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.  It is pathetic.  Obama is laughing at them.

Does anyone remember this @BillMaher clip when he got fired from ABC- in fact fired like a dog!  
@MeeMawBellefleu Thank you- I did!
@kidsalty No
@SimonNWrestler Thank you.
@KingOf_Class Thank you.
@colinhaney Great!
@manc999 Write to Mark Burnett.
@msmaddiexo Thank you.
@thesween_bean Thank you.
If everybody sued the Journal News for revealing their info (guns)- paper would go out of business.
Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years.
Lance Armstrong was given veryvery bad advice!
Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.
Look I have always liked Lance Armstrong- I just hated what he did to himself including recently. His life will now be hell.
The first ever All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC premieres Sunday March 3rd!  
Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco.
.or mentally troubled (or a con).
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid.
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
IMO- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
.@ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting- stop being so politically correct!
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity- we just presented him with a demand notice.
.@BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford.
.@BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep- better than Sominex.
.@HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.
I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking?"
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide.
.@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!
All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame. He has paid his penalty!
Trump Doral’s renovations are right on schedule  
Miss Alabama @_KatherineWebb stopped by to say hello today.  
You wouldn't believe how tall and beautiful @_KatherineWebb is- 6'5" in heels. She is also a total winner in.  
@tman99us @_KatherineWebb  That's Shaquille O'Neal's shoe.
Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night. Lawsuits &amp; failure will follow him!
.@Oprah was great- amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life. Why did he ever do that interview?
The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong!
Te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid.
I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman vote—thankfully he did not win.
Alabama people are saying their team has real football &amp; real girlfriends—not good for Notre Dame—but they’ll be back!
.@Deadspin guys are total losers—they had their story stolen right from under their bad complexions—other media capitalized!
Dummies @Deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media.
.@Deadspin will never make it—they don’t understand graciousness or money—and best guy is leaving?
.@Deadspin’s disgusting response will teach me &amp; others not to be nice anymore—a sad lesson.
@ISHIMWEPatrick @BuzzFeedPSA  Thanks Patrick-a great compliment.
@AMalfas  She can't but I adore her.
@efswagner Thanks.
@ThePhilliesGirl @CrossingBroad @Deadspin  Sad losers!
@cmedenise Thanks.
@Brunhooooo  Wrong!
@lcf42 @Deadspin They are total losers.

@MattMogul Happy Birthday tomorrow Matt
Republicans and Democrats must come together now to make America great again!
Wow.NYT reports @celebrityapprentice was the number 1 show in branding on television for all of 2012.
I wish President @BarackObama the best of luck in his second term.
.Whether you are a Republican or Democrat we should hope that Pres. @BarackObama  does a great job for the country.
My @foxandfriends interview discussing Pres. Obama’s inauguration @GOP debt plan &amp; @CelebApprentice #1 branding  
Obama’s second term is going to very tough for the Republicans.  The Republicans must pick their battles wisely and play smart.
“Golfer bids $130000 for round with Donald Trump” in Scotland for charity  
Get ready for the fireworks between @OMAROSA &amp; @latoyajackson in 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice!  Neither one will back down.
Hypocrites! @JamesOKeefeIII’s new video shows Journal News reporters refusing to designate their homes as ‘gun free’  
Glad to hear @InsideEdition has hired @_KatherineWebb to cover @SuperBowl.  She will be absolutely terrific! Miss USA pageant is proud.

The President’s speech was very combative toward Republicans—they have obviously not earned his respect!
Republicans don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now!
If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always available-or can recommend some really good ones!
Obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it-wow he really feels emboldened.
Part of Obama’s new-found confidence is that the Republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively.
@chididdy57 @lancearmstrong  Well he's now paying a big price!
@eakrogh  Emil-great &amp; do well with it!
@MooreReva Thanks Myriam-starts on Sunday March 3rd @NBC at 9 pm EST
@HoltonHancock  Thanks and enjoy!
@Coteter @BarackObama  Just success for our country!
@TorresTerrell @BarackObama  Thanks!
@mikayladreyer  Thanks!
@tubby511 @BarackObama  He is too smart to do that!
@Kaszie @BarackObama Casandra-It's not-thanks.
@CoCo471031 You really sound like a loser no-name!
@MeattHead_ @souljaboy @KennicotAsks Winning!
@MattONU @billmaher  Not looking like it!
@Gonzobeachboy  I don't go away!
You must promise that you will never cheat off Manti Te’o’s test papers.
@mscijihenderson Midas Touch is a good choice for those with entrepreneurial interests.
@TheDarangatang Thanks Timothy.
@sprinkler22 @GIL1FRESNOCA  Very nice thanks Barb.

Here I am with @RodStewart at Mar-a-Lago.  
@TheCleverLoop  True!
@jeffjarvis  You were a terrible editor who got fired?-and you were wrong.
@Albertenstein @BostonGlobe And a dumb guy!
@PhakzenVanKlipz  Only tell the political truth-thanks.
My @Shalom_TV interview discussing my video endorsement of @IsraeliPM @netanyahu and past visits to @Israel  
@JediJerad  Thanks Jedi.
@stevegpritchett  Thanks Steve!
@hmachann  Thanks Heidi.
@lynn5101953 Sadly true!
Via @EW: “@CelebApprentice All-Stars' first trailer”  
.@KeithUrban is excellent on American Idol—great touch solid guy!
@AnthonyNoTweet  Make sure you are doing what you love to do. You need passion to keep you going.
@Marvelle Thank you-a great compliment.
@ghosttoast99  I do-and say hello to Carson.
.@BarbaraJWalters   Barbara—get better fast &amp; stay healthy forever.
@adkradio Thanks and good luck.
@ritter1025  Ellis-get well soon!
The worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as Republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months. Pathetic!
Republicans are always worried about their general approval. With proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.
Watch this great behind the scenes video of @IvankaTrump's Spring 2013 photo shoot-  
One positive from last week for Lance was that everyone was focused on Manti Te'o!  Why did Lance do that interview?
The Tea Party delivered the House for @GOP so they could be fiscally responsible. Instead they have been irresponsible!
Has Pres. Obama or the White House told the public what happened in Algeria yet?  Where’s the media?
Scary. Over 8332000 Americans left the work force during Obama's first term  
Happy 8th Anniversary to @MELANIATRUMP.
