Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
THe Art of the Deal--"The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT CAP and BALANCE.
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.

@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit.How low have we as a nation sunk?
@johnboehner  @EricCantor  "You can't con people.if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on." - The Art of the Deal
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly.
The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama. http://t.co/9gFfiFM #trumpvlog

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.

China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership it can be stopped.

The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation.
The Iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts. They laugh at us. We can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons.
The only way for Medicare and Social Security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy. @BarackObama doesn't get it.

The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first.
Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama. He is a disaster.
@BarackObama now says  that he is an "underdog in 2012." America should be so lucky. We still need a solid candidate.
@BarackObama sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels.  They were used in the murders of Americans . Where is the outrage?
China is threatening Washington over the currency bill.  We should pass it immediately.
Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans. Yet they want to cut military spending.

My thoughts on Gadhafi's death @BarackObama and the misery index. http://t.co/hgarmpIE #trumpvlog
Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy not a friend.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.
We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. We should be reimbursed with oil! -- Don't give it to Iran.

I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.

Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.

Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136260 per household a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc.

Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip http://t.co/T5xzkNuL  They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!

Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88921000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: http://t.co/NY3DQGrT   Disaster.
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!

The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?

Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday September 24 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!

It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.

I promise to do a new #trumpvlog when I get back next week---- lots of requests. Thanks!
Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well. She is a terrific person.
My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes. Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate? #Debate #Obama
.@acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate. @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance. Now go win CO!

Looking forward to Sunday’s speech in the ExCel Centre. http://t.co/SV6KAS1E
More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.  A new record.  See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial death penalty.
My @foxandfriends interview discussing Obama's failed and dangerous foreign policy and the real unemployment numbers http://t.co/6Y1UToMt
I would do same thing if I were China.  They want Obama. http://t.co/sal9WpKV
A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://t.co/0acwArSn  Four more years?
Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses http://t.co/A8UyBknk Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
.@jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
Greece should get out of the euro &amp; go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
California gas prices going thru the roof others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates the real state of unemployment &amp; bias media http://t.co/p8U4JmYg
Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also not a pressure player.
In the end Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again a lot.
George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.

When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly after the election!
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
With these record high gas prices what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts you need to know about real estate.” - Think Like a Billionaire
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting I promise.
"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." -- Mitt
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
Remember Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
"It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election we decide whether we become great again.
I just had to fire someone he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking?
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding http://t.co/1XB8OK2t  Do people think this is fair?
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird."  -- @MittRomney
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
Even with lower profit projections American firms are still throwing money into China http://t.co/xRJlsxqB  Obama is killing investment.
Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.

"When everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it." -- Henry Ford
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2
Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate.should be a great time
Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince http://t.co/6KErqMup  Sounds like his book bio!
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? http://t.co/upa00265 Who is this guy?
Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data http://t.co/5wDEDsJZ

Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.
"Wing bangers"-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!
"There are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still." -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds." Do you believe?
Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
With our amazing All Star cast @Joan_Rivers @johnrich @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." --@PaulRyanVP
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." -- Warren G. Bennis
I told you whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.
Tonight despite everything put A-Rod in the lineup.
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont) http://t.co/2rVgPfmo
No I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go they win.
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
"Romney Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation" http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC
Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications &amp; records
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night Obama is finished!

"The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government." -- @MittRomney

Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic my first season winner will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have in my opinion zero talent.
.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit I wish the stuff worked.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
.@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing I'll be live tweeting the debate
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
Between Libya the national security leaks and Fast &amp; Furious Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
.@washtimes "@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'" http://t.co/CcRkSlHY
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
Get ready for tonight!
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
For political purposes only Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama weak on immigration. All words no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
You talk tough Mr. President but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Obama better than last time but again @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Verlander pitched great but @Yankees look truly defeated.
At the debate the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
Remember I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment.its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it he broke his foot.
I still love Derek he is a winner!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--&amp; all the "biggies." It's like having your own newspaper.

Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVF
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.
Remember new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally &amp; aesthetically.
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance.
.Bad decisions can be devastating.
"Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries"  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media
.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for CC
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters even A-Rod they got you there.
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.

I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays however.
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year the fans will be happy.
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?

@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp; worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio.
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.
Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son Franklin Graham.

Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?"  Sad!
.@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low even for them.
Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which under Graydon Carter will be sooner rather than later.
No surprise welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama. http://t.co/pHREg2Cj  He is the food stamp &amp; welfare "king"
.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.  What a surprise!
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.

Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community &amp; are very expensive &amp; unreliable.
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.

Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single spread out shots! What do we have to lose.
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
.@Toure when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage stop by and say hello.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
.@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but of course Piers is a lot smarter than you
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years he will thank me. Be smart Robert.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!
Well this is it the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
.@MittRomney looks much calmer and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.
I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping he gave his enemies an opening.
No matter what happens in the election @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it even with his terrible record.

.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing not the President.
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert &amp; Kristen.I don't have time except to say "Robert drop her she cheated on you &amp; will again!"
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!
Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated "'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters.
.that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump."
.@BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--&amp; yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.

RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases records http://t.co/xCQbR1j2
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008 American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records http://t.co/Cn8bn9LH #Election2012
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
. By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public.
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
Just stated by a total pro: "You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."

Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc &amp; @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson.
Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic &amp; @BillRancic did not name their son Donald.  Unbelievable.
.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement--you just don't get it!

“Our side needs Donald Trump.” -- @AnnCoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night.  Thanks Ann.
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!
@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.

China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports http://t.co/eShZeqgZ  We need @MittRomney to rein them in.
Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China" http://t.co/Fe2gkSlg I don't think this was a gaffe.
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires.
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
"The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants." --The America We Deserve
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
.instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain.
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide.
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity. http://t.co/FjVYwWR4

Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? DJT
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!
Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
.Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
By the way where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.

I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But he just doesn't have what it takes.and he never will.
Alert.The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing.he is no leader.
@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly.you're terrific!

@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!
A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?
While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.

If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower call office.
All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below move out!
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
Not only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
Because of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others I stayed open. http://t.co/ONelqemC
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!

@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOl
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?

There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice once he releases all of his records.

President Obama please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
President Obama if it is important to you I will substantially increase the $5M offer!

Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
President Obama missed the deadline!

Press release. Video response to follow. http://t.co/3Xz74ipi
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency. http://t.co/oK9SpIc7
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records he would have refused.
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp; websites as to their professionalism &amp; fairness—many people asking for this.
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
With long gas lines &amp; total disarray from storm the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
.@Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
.@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional.
.@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly I won't be able to do it.
.@TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice apology accepted!
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island &amp; Long Island.
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
Interestingly the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
Unemployment is now 7.9%.  Four years and $6.5T later that is really bad!

Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney. All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel?
Undecideds in OHPA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.

Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble.like never before.
Our nation is a once great nation divided!
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years.stay strong and never give up!
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.

The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster!

The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!

Brian if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow.

Millions without electricity across NY &amp; NJ. The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in the Republicans lost. What a waste of money.
The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.
It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.  We will fight on!
Now that the election is over watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China--my prediction.

Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!
Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again http://t.co/v7RwPT0P Thanks for letting us know now
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
.@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi.
With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.
At the end of the day Obama won the battleground states by less than 500000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes http://t.co/oX6JYnqE  They will be sent to patrol our coasts Obama won't do anything.

Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio &amp; he would be President.

Of the 9 battleground states we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP &amp; glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.

Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart.I hope!
I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help.

@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxter—Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap &amp; boring documentary is a tremendous flop.

Negotiation tip #1:  The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.
.If you plan for the worst—if you can live with the worst—the good will always take care of itself.
Negotiation tip #2:  I always go into the deal anticipating the worst.

Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco.
.or mentally troubled (or a con).
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid.
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
.@ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting--- stop being so politically correct!
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice.
.@BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford.
.@BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex.
.@HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.
I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking?"
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide.

The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong!
Te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid.
I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman vote—thankfully he did not win.
Alabama people are saying their team has real football &amp; real girlfriends—not good for Notre Dame—but they’ll be back!

@RoxanneQuintana  Thanks Roxanne.
. It is a very effective &amp; commonly used business tool.
People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals.
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool.
Speaker John Boehner who I like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is he can’t stand them!
.So far he has been a complete failure at doing so. He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
An individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me.
.@MarissaMayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. She is doing a great job!

I'm at Trump Doral right now Tiger will tee off shortly.
I will be live tweeting during the @ApprenticeNBC tonight at 9PM ET.
That was some episode last week-we've got a great cast!
Bret had a target on his back from the get go.
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama.
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n?
Gary as the Cat in the Hat? He can work it out.
On the whole the teams seem to be working well together. No wars.yet.
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail.is somebody confused?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp; presentation.
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary while 'adorable' is a distraction?
Re Omarosa: Nasty tough or smart.or all?
Which team is your favorite?
It's true. Dennis is really into this-very animated. I have never seen him this way before.
Re my hair-Should I change it? What do you think?
The losing team is now back in boardroom. I can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out.

We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.

I totally respect that Angelina Jolie has shown such great bravery in the face of danger - she has really come a long and positive way!
The "lady" in Chicago that I'm fighting owes me $500 000 and is sophisticated  &amp; vicious. She made up a story &amp; plays the "age card" - bad!
The three political disasters could lead to a major and complete political meltdown!
I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.? Can we handle yet another?
@A_Beil   Thanks Andrew.
@polotodd804  This is one of the worst made and inaccurate documentaries I have ever seen. Filmmaker Mike Tollin has zero talent.Also-boring
@Roddy_Brown Thanks!
@sarah_bales1 True and thanks.
@Jared808 @commonguymd @AP True!
If these scandals happened before the election Obama could not have won.
Obama &amp; his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election. Mitt must be going wild thinking about it!

America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt!
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on?
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control.
Many generals and military leaders are now saying "I told you so!"  They say this will have big impact on military strength &amp; national sec.
Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so "politically correct" or we won't have a Country to run anymore!
I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there kept the oil! DUMB
Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them
In other words our military has a very big problem!
Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).Casting has already begun for next season.
@CCV77   Thanks very nice.
Congratulations to my friend @seanhannity on @hannityshow 1000th show consecutively #1 in his time slot! Great going!
.@NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice &amp; charitable that they employ the no-talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait.
Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact the stoppers have become the abusers.
The sexual abuse that is so rampant has according to generals greatly weakened our military. They have failed to stop it.

One season ends and another starts.  Already casting for the next @ApprenticeNBC. Great news for charity--$13 million so far.

The lawyer I just beat in Chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @DannyZuker. Come on Danny make the bet!
If @DannyZuker competed against me and.won (which not too many people do) he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity!

According to Bill O'Reilly 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.
Sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
When it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!

Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses
Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also recent asks?
How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!
After years of long stops then starts why did dopey Eric Scheiderman tell people in The Trump Org. "this case is going awaywe have no case
What did our very stupid &amp; ineffective A.G. Eric Schneidean during his trips to MY office tell me about President Obama &amp; Governor Cuomo?
Wow l just found out that A.G. Schneiderman met with President Obama in Syracuse on Thursday --- and sued me on Saturday! Same as IRS etc.

Gov. Cuomo's Moreland Comm should be looking at AG Schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$
I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman &amp; the terrible job he has done for NY.
Amazing! AG Schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over Wall St.

I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise?
That said the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess not us.We should start rebuilding our own country &amp; military.
@walaa_3ssaf   No dopey I would not go into Syria but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.

Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing!
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the U.S. will look very bad!
How bad has our "leader" made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing!
Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the "PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR"
Obama now just wants to save face Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-&amp; laugh at us!
Be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.

Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!

We don't have the leadership including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it.

Obama and Kerry are bungling Syria by the hour. They have set America’s deterrence &amp; stature back by years. Amateurs!

Assad will never give up his chemical weapons. He has spent years and billions accumulating them. This is all a ruse.

The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!
This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad. President in trouble!
Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
Here we go!
Does he look sharp smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
Bottom line I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin a very dangerous lifeline at that!
Wow Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner and both lost. For a while when Spitzer was way up it seemed that I was a lone voice! Good power
Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer. Remember in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of usthen sued for $40 million.Dopey guy!
Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose. He goes after a school with a 98% approval ratingleaves biggies alone
The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. The so-called rebels must be thoroughly confused!
Assad hit the jackpot!
Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see worse than Spitzer or Weiner
Spitzer and Weiner lost lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the PRIMARY. He has done a really poor job!
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. I fought him when others retreated out of fear. NEVER GIVE UP!
Putin is having such a good time. Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. Do not fearwe are a NATION OF POTENTIAL
Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY jobs healthcare and all of our many problems. Forget Syria and make America great again!

The ObamaCare website will cost over $1.5B when all is said and done. Crazy!
@GOP House has the right bill: “If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it.” The Senate must take it up on a vote!
Wow just watching the news.ObamaCare and the website are TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. Costs are through the roof. This could be ruinous to U.S.!
Lies and incompetence - the two words that are most closely associated with ObamaCare!
I would gain a whole new respect for President Obama if he would say "look we made a big mistake sorry!" No more lies or deception.

When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie-even the Senate Democrats are angry with him!
Just sit back and watch ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. The website is the best part of this mess!
She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec.Sebelius. She has done great harm to many people and must be fired. Incompetent!
Put Kathleen Sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say YOU'RE FIRED! Let her go home to her family and rest. BRING IN TOP FLIGHT PEOPLE!
Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years!
A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship.
If Democrats do not start opposing ObamaCare and fast Republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 - far greater than any predictions!

Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!
If we could force Russia China and other competitors to use ObamaCare we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success!
Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!
If Justice Roberts had done the right thing and voted against ObamaCare our country would be in a lot better shape right now! TOTAL TURMOIL
The Republicans must be patient and smart - ObamaCare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible!
While I was in Moscow I see that President Obsma apologized for his lie I mean statement on ObamaCare! How nice of him to be so forthright
Don't worry when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made we will start doing the right things.
WE WILL ONLY BE THE LAND OF THE FREE AS LONG AS WE ARE HOME OF THE BRAVE!

ObamaCare is one of the worst political disasters of all time - 4992343 AMERICANS LOSING COVERAGE LESS THAN 50OOO NEW SIGNUPS.
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare. His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare.
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered!
No matter how far down a path you go if it's the wrong path turn around and go back home - before it is too late.
Can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the ObamaCare website is not a US citizen—she’s from Colombia.
The same people that built the ObamaCare website used as the face of the website someone who is not a US citizen. Incompetent.

13 BILLION 4.5 BILLION-these are the stupid settlements that J.P.Morgan just made. Why don't they FIGHT? No wonder they keep getting sued.
The real J.P.Morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes. A settler is a soft target
I wonder what the late great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled?
Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatoryracist and can be viewed as bullying
I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?
The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.
How did the NCAA which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big &amp; reputation shattering settlement from Penn State. Others zero!
I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster. AMAZING!

Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback. Good game- not over yet!
Tom Brady is a good friend of mine a great player a great guy and a total winner! Fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs!
John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one
The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal especially one that is not complete is that it shows weakness to the other side
I know it has been many years since our country made great deals but isn't it about time we start right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL.  Go get it and others Washington - you really can do better!
After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars J.P.Morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine-why did they settle then-DUMB!
Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact and focus on the positives.
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge. Everything starts with you.
Who would  you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford? My money is on Ford.

Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie announce that ObamaCare was a mistake and deal a really great plan!
