Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks-First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
THe Art of the Deal-"The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT CAP and BALANCE.
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.
@johnboehner Message for House GOP  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it." - The Art of the Deal.
@Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq? What are u doing about this?   
ObamaCare Tragedy Primed to Further Explode the Deficit   
House GOP wants to cut Medicare Obama took $500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare. Both Wrong!

@BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Arab world does not like it  
US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US-and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower Chicago are on the list!
Take a look at   
CUT CAP AND BALANCE. TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY!
What is better advice- "The Art of the Deal" or "Rules for Radicals"? I know which one @BarackObama prefers.
Who will be the next @TheRealTeenUSA? Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa.com  #TeenUSA
@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. T-E-A  
@marcorubio is right. We need to create more taxpayers not more taxes. CUT CAP AND BALANCE.   
Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of  their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday.
#trumpvlog The Republicans must act now don't let @barackobama push you around.  
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit.How low have we as a nation sunk?
@johnboehner  @EricCantor  "You can't con people.if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on." - The Art of the Deal
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure-as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem-not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.
"China is our enemy-they want to destroy us" - Redstate Interview
"The Gang of Six" - yet another unmitigated disaster. ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. T-E-A.

Ronald Kessler's new book "The Secrets of the FBI" is a great book that should be read by everyone.
Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy-not cuts on the elderly.
The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama.  
Obama sadly has no business or private sector background-and it shows.
Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions-cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors.
My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox.  
My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends - "GOP Crazy If  They Don't Get Everything They  Want"   
America's debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking.
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves-US needs our toughest negotiator-and fast!
Higher Taxes kill job creation-cut wild government spending and waste.
Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @QVC at 1 a.m.  So proud of her!
"Know when to walk away from the table."   The Art of the Deal
People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time-they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous!
My interview yesterday from Newsmax - "Obama Is  'Now Totally Lost'  Boehner Must Not Fold"   
@KarlRove's @CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt borrowing from China. Didn't Bush do the same thing?
Please tweet me your questions to answer in my #trumpvlog.
@Johnboehner  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it."  -The Art of the Deal
My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night. In case you missed her you can see her again tonight on @QVC at 7 pm ET
@BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet. He's totally lost ineffective desperate. GOP has its best chance to make a great deal
I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee a fine American  
I just got Mike Leach's new book  Swing Your Sword. He's a great coach and he's written a great book. It's definitely worth reading.
"Never quit and always hit back" - The Art of the Comeback
Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? Bad idea.
If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses  - "Watch the fine details in every deal" - The Art of the Deal
Watched Sean Hannity last night - a great guy.
No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan-important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems-Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.
Your questions about my desk answered in today's #trumpvlog.  
The more you learn about the debt deal the worse it gets.

No taxes the only good thing about DC Debt Deal.
Why I would not have approved the deal.  
All those politicians in Washington and not one good negotiator.
Wake Up America - China is eating our lunch.
I believe America can be great only with proper leadership.
Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House - they just don't get it.
Morning Joe Panel is stealing many of  my statements and ideas to better America without giving credit - the story of my life!

My interview last night with Greta on Fox News

Congress should get back to Washington but @BarackObama doesn't want to interrupt his vacation in Martha's Vineyard.
Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times. OPEC continues to rip us off. Not worth $30. New leadership needed.
The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars. Wrong move.
My interview from yesterday with #Apprentice Andy on @AmericaNowRadio  
I was on CNBC this morning talking about the market and America's financial future   
Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader.
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate?
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mike Huckebee a great guy said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.
Economic growth can save Social Security Medicare and America.
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump-I tell CNBC I am buying stocks- and the market goes up.
@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.  Nice work ethic.
My thoughts on the Republican Party in today's #trumpvlog.  
Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths. Very troubling.
China is a threat to America. They are not our friend.
I was interviewed by Greta Van Susteren today here at Trump Tower.  Tune in tonight on Fox News at 10 p.m.… (cont)

China owes us money.  
Amazing-Obama speaks market goes  DOWN-Trump tells CNBC he's buying stock-market goes UP - should not be that way!
My interview this morning on Good Morning America  with George Stephanopoulos   
@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating. Why so high?

Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.
@MacMiller will enjoy today's #trumpvlog.  
Karl Rove -lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House-gave us Obama.
Many people have been asking to see my plane The Apprentice's @AmandaTMiller will give you a tour.  
Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks-US wastes  trillions.
You can listen to my interview today with Jay Sekulow Live and the @JordanSekulow show here  
@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. Not create any jobs. 2. Borrow more money from China.
@BarackObama is sure a master delegator. He has sent @Joe_Biden to China. The Chinese are laughing at us. We MUST do better.
Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens.

We don't need another stimulus. The first one was a complete failure. Why repeat the same mistake?
@RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration. Wrong for media to ignore him.
We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way-why is Europe getting the oil?
Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over.
As bad as Qaddafi was-what comes next in Libya will be worse-just watch.
Just as I predicted @Joe_Biden was a complete disaster in China. He condoned the Chinese one-child policy an… (cont)  
We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation. What are we getting back?
There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election.
@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt-will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion.
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership it can be stopped.
America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People.
I'm very proud of the work my son @EricTrump has been doing with the @EricTrumpFDN take a look.  
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime.
There is no substitute for private sector experience.
More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties-I agree.
Hurricane Irene and Libya in today's #trumpvlog.  
Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support-we don't even ask!
Iran admits to aiding the Libyan "Rebels" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn?  
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution.
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber-now.
China's business interests reach far and wide-even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.
My thoughts on Dick Cheney and his new book…  
Libya is being taken over by Islamic radicals-with @BarackObama's open support.
With gas prices rising and the economy failing  @BarackObama seeks to have his EPA raise energy prices by $109B   
I'll be  on Greta Van Susteren's show tonight at 10 PM on FoxNews. Tune in.
We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel-if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it.
My interview with @gretawire last night - "Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'"   
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.
Make no mistake-Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.
Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions.
Oil is double the price now compared to last year-OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama.
Fast and Furious   gun running goes all the way to the White House.  We need answers now!
@BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs.  His job is costing America all of ours.
The UN is about to use its Assembly to attack @Israel. We should defund the UN entirely if they can't act resp… (cont)  
@BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs - instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment.
USA should take oil from Iraq in repayment for their liberation.   
US should have told Libya "Rebels" - give us 50% of your oil for our military support.
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare-not cuts on Seniors.
Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers?
America needs a tough negotiator-not a community organizer.
My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews:  @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'   
My interview yesterday with @IngrahamAngle   
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record.
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @BarackObama is their favorite client.
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program? The US should look at future funding.
@IvankaTrump always makes me proud     
I watched POTUS speech from Europe-same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs.
@BarackObama-the stimulus will fail just like the first.
Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate.  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.  America will boom.
Very exciting. I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal!
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary.
The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world. We have fallen from first under @BarackObama.
Watch the 2011 #MissUniverse Pageant tonight at 9PM on NBC.  
My thoughts on @andyroddick in today's #trumpvlog.  
The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations. Government is not the solution.
Friends in NY-9 let @BarackObama know that you don't approve of his mistreatment of @Israel.  Vote for @Bobturner9th tomorrow!
I'm urging my friends in Brooklyn to vote for Bob Turner tomorrow-send @barackobama a message.text
