Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
THe Art of the Deal--"The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT CAP and BALANCE.
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.

@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?
@johnboehner  @EricCantor  "You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on." - The Art of the Deal
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?

The Iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts. They laugh at us. We can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons.
The only way for Medicare and Social Security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy. @BarackObama doesn't get it.

The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first.
Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama. He is a disaster.
@BarackObama now says  that he is an "underdog in 2012." America should be so lucky. We still need a solid candidate.
@BarackObama sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels.  They were used in the murders of Americans . Where is the outrage?
China is threatening Washington over the currency bill.  We should pass it immediately.
Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans. Yet they want to cut military spending.

Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy not a friend.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.

Why did @BarackObama let Iran keep our drone? Now it is going straight to the Chinese. He should have taken it out.
@BarackObama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 Presidents combined. He is simply out of control.
